websocket directory is intended to hold files for BCI telehealth robot website. Will be run on flask web server (probably hosted on AWS) and inside a docker container. In order to compile, will need to download docker from their website. 
server.py is intended to be ran separately in a different docker container. It waits for websocket connections and then redirects it to other clients. Initially made for another purpose, so needs to be edited. Relies on clients and streams
sending their type in connection websocket connection arguments.
